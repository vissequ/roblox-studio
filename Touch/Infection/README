If placed correctly these scripts will "infect" a player when they touch a target area.
This "infection" will change their avatar and place them on the Infection team.
The teams are automatically created by the modulescript.
The modulescript MUST be placed in ServerScriptService.
The serverscript MUST be placed inside of the modulescript.
